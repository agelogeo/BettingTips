	<h2 style="text-align: center; ">Over 1.5 goals football betting strategy</h2>
	<h3>The Over 1.5 goals system is a far more reliable way to place bets than ordinary Over 2.5.</h3>
	<hr>
	<div class="uk-alert" style="text-align: center;">"Under 1.5 goals" means, we'd expect 0 or 1 goals. "Over 1.5 goals" means, we need to see at least 2 goals in the match.</div>
	<h3>Bets for this strategy are never placed before the match, only on Live In-play games.</h3>
	<p>The odds for Over 1.5 goals tend to raise fast. Before the game prices for Over 1.5 goals are 1.30 or more. Not enough to make a decent profit. Once the game begins each minute without a goal raises the odds.</p>
	<p>After 15 minutes you can expect odds about 1.45 and after 30 minutes about 1.70. If the first half doesn't produce any goals at all - the odds could get
		<strong>up to 2.0 or over!</strong>
	</p>
	<p>This is what we are waiting for and that's when we'll place our bet. If you want, you can place a bet after 40 minutes in the first half or during the half-time. The sooner you place, the lower your profit will be.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Once the goal is scored the odds will drop usually back to 1.5 and putting you in a perfect position to sell the bet or make a cash-out if your bookmaker supports that. The time of the first goal also determines how much you'll win. In an ideal position, the first goal will be scored between 46th and 55th minute. And that happens very often!</p>
	<div class="uk-alert" style="text-align: center;">Don't place any bets in the first 30 or 40 minutes of the game. After that (preferably during half time) bet on Over 1.5 goals! Use this strategy on games that are available for live betting and the game is a strong candidate for Over 2.5 goals.</div>
	<p>If an early goal surprises you - forget this game and move on. This strategy is not suitable anymore.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Here is a list of games we played during our strategy testing period. We have listed the time of placing the bet, the stake and odds.</p>
	<ul >
		<li>
			Roma - Cagliari. In 27' minute Over 1.5 goals - 30€ @ 1.5. Goal soon after that and Lay at 1.19.</li>
		<li>
			Portsmouth - Newcastle. 47' - back Over 1.5 goals - 30€ @ 2.44. Goal one minute later - Lay 30€ @ 1.41. The game ended 0-3!</li>
		<li>
			Chelsea - Westham, 28' - Back Over 1.5 goals - 30€ @ 1.53. After 10 minutes goal and Lay 30€ @ 1.12</li>
		<li>
			Hoffenheim - Schalke - 26' - Back Over 1.5 goals - 50€ @ 1.55. In 39' minute goal and Lay 47€ @ 1.19.</li>
		<li>
			Malaga - Nunmancia. 46' - Back Over 1.5 goals - 22€ @ 2.36, in 88' minute two goals for 2-0!</li>
		<li>
			Sevilla - Villareal. 25' - Back Over 1.5 goals - 20€ @ 1.68. In 35' minute goal and Lay 20€ @ 1.32</li>
		<li>
			Kaiserslautern - Freiburg. 15' - Back Over 1.5 goals - 69€ @ 1.50. No goals. In 30' again 20€ @ 1.90 and in 46' minute once again 12€ @ 2.36. First goal in 57' minute, and another one later. All bets won!</li>
		<li>
			Charlton - Derby. 15' - Back Over 1.5 goals - 40€ @ 1.6. In 35' goal and Lay 40€ @ 1.21.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All games have made money! Only two out of ten were losers -
		<strong>Sassuolo - Ancona</strong> (-16€ - one goal scored and it was too late in the match to trade without loss) and
		<strong>Recreativo de Huelva - Osasuna</strong> where we placed the bet in 47th minute 16€ @ 3, but the first goal came very late in the 87th minute. Too late to trade.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, the teams will keep you on the edge for 80 minutes, before the action starts. Take a look at this:</p>
	
	<h4>Lens - Montpellier</h4>
	<p>First we placed a bet on Over 1.5 goals at 1.55 and once again at 2.5, and both goals were scored in the last three minutes!
		<strong>+74.18€!</strong>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Over 1.5 goals is a great universal system. The only downside is - you'll have to watch the games or at least keep a track of live-score and you'll need time to do that. But in the end - it's worth it! If you're serious about making money with betting, this strategy could be one of your main money makers.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>QUICK SUMMARY:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Bet on over 1,5 goals instead of 2,5</p></li>
		<li><p>Analyze the games and only the ones predicted for over 2,5 qualify for this strategy</p></li>
		<li><p>Don't place any bets until the odds for over 1,5 goals reach at least 1,50 or more (we recommend waiting for 40 minutes or the whole first half)</p></li>
		<li><p>If the goal is scored in the first 60 minutes of the game, you'll be making money if you cash out or you can leave the bet open and wait for another goal. This depends on what you see if you're watching the game. If the goal is hanging in the air - keep it open.</p></li>
		<li><p style="padding-bottom: 70px;">Play this strategy on a betting exchange or on our bookmakers with cash-out function.</p></li>
